Instructions:

Organize Files: Make sure your repository includes:
preprocessing.py: Script for data preprocessing.
train_model.py: Script for model training.
deploy_model.py: Script for deployment setup.
Dockerfile: For containerization.
requirements.txt: List all dependencies.
app.py: A simple API for serving the model (if applicable).
Version Control: Ensure that each stage (preprocessing, training, deployment) is well-documented in commits.
Branching Strategy: Use branches for different phases (e.g., preprocessing, training, deployment).

# Machine Learning Model Deployment Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates the end-to-end deployment of a machine learning model, from data preprocessing to monitoring in production.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Docker
- AWS account (for EC2 setup)
- Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone Repository:** 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EAtech-bit/ML_Project.git
   cd ML_Project
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Data Preprocessing:**
   ```bash
   python preprocessing.py
   ```

4. **Model Training:**
   ```bash
   python train_model.py
   ```

5. **Deploy Using Docker:**
   ```bash
   docker build -t mymodel:latest .
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 mymodel:latest
   ```

## Deployment Pipeline
- Use Jenkins or GitLab CI/CD to automate deployment steps. See `Jenkinsfile` or `.gitlab-ci.yml`.

## Monitoring
- Set up alerts using AWS CloudWatch to monitor CPU usage and other key metrics.
